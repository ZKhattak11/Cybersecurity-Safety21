## Summary of Dataset  

This research is based on the premise that perfect protection from cyberattacks is not realistic. Thus, the proposed research focuses on analyzing the vulnerability of cooperative driving relying on infrastructure based communication from real-field experimental data collected at the Aberdeen center in Maryland. Multiple cyberattacks including sensor anomalies, fake BSMs, replay and denial of service were emulated. Furthermore, the driving conditions from the field experiment were emulated within a realistic simulation environment to test the consequences of different types of cyberattacks on safety effects of transportation systems and analyze crash types and severity. Long short-term memory with Gaussian mixture (LAGMM) model were utilized to design efficient and effective anomaly detection method for accounting the temporal relations of trajectories, so that anomalous behavior can be detected in real-time and the severe consequences of cyberattack or sensor anomalies can be avoided.

**Licenses/restrictions placed on the data:** This document is disseminated under the sponsorship of the U.S. Department of Transportation in the interest of information exchange. The United States Government assumes no liability for the contents thereof.  

**Was data derived from another source?:** Yes. This study utilized data from field tests conducted by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) (Tiernan et al., 2017) in collaboration with Volpe Center for a platooning proof of concept based on CACC and ACC. The field tests were conducted on a 4.5-mile test track at Aberdeen Center in Maryland. A fleet of five Cadillac SRX vehicles were equipped with CACC controllers, with variations of LV and FVs used for conducting the field tests. The test track geometry including grades, lane markings, width, and curvature are similar to a typical US highway. For more information on the data's origin, consult the final report <>. The work reported in this report is taken from published articles "Anomaly Detection in Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Trajectories Using LSTM Autoencoder and Gaussian Mixture Model" <https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics13071251> and "Cybersecurity vulnerability and resilience of cooperative driving automation for energy efficiency and flow stability in smart cities" <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2024.105368>, which were sponsored by this project under Safety 21 BIL UTC and the work was conducted through the funding provided by the project

## D. Methodological Information   

**Description of methods used for collection/generation of data:** The cyberattack anomalies were simulated due to lack of publicly available anomalous CAV sensor data. The sensors have been shown to have vulnerability to cyberattacks and sensor failures by past research (Currie, 2015; Petit & Shladover, 2015; Trippel et al., 2017). A reasonable subset of likely attacks was subjected to a detailed investigation through a series of case studies. The cyberattacks were selected based on a higher probability for an attacker to launch these attacks, the ability to compromise CAV operation and safety, and a requirement that the attack needs a reasonable level of expertise and cost. Some examples of the types of attacks to be considered include. 
1. Senor anomalies
2. Infrastructure elements compromised by attacks at the V2I communication 
3. Communication at the vehicle level compromised by attacks at the network level (V2V)

More methodology information can be found in the final report.
